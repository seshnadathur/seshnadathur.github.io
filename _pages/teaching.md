Undergraduate teaching
---
I held the post of Stipendiary Lecturer in Physics at Trinity College, Oxford, from 2007-2011, at 30% FTE. I taught the 
following courses:
- *Mathematical Methods I and II*: covering differential calculus, complex numbers/analysis, ODEs, linear algebra, 
vector calculus,  waves
- *Physics 2*: covering the sections on optics and circuit theory

to first-year (Prelims) students in a tutorial setting (5-7 students per year, classes in groups of 2). I was also 
responsible for college admissions including interviews, 'collections' (termly examinations) and pastoral care.

Some testimonials I received from students:
>"I use the way you ran tutorials for all my small-group teaching"

Patrick Dunne (at Trinity 2008-12, now UKRI Future Leaders Fellow at Imperial College)

>"We learned more from your classes than any others in our degree"

Class of 2010, on graduation in 2014 

 Graduate teaching

 I have taught the following PhD-level courses:
 - *Observational Cosmology*: contribution to core PhD course, covering CMB x LSS techniques (SZ, ISW techniques), at 
 ICG Portsmouth, 2017-2020
 - *Statistical Methods for Cosmic Structures*: advanced PhD course (covering spherical collapse, halo
 mass function, Press-Schechter theory, excursion set model, halo model, void number function) at ICG Portsmouth, 2017
 - *MCMC methods for cosmology*: advanced PhD course at ICG Portsmouth, 2019. A Jupyter notebook containing some of 
 course material used is available 
 [here](https://github.com/seshnadathur/IntroductionToMCMC/blob/master/IntroductionToMCMCMethodsLectures.ipynb). I also 
 gave lectures covering par tof this material at the Les Houches Euclid Advanced School in 2020, slides available 
 [here](https://github.com/seshnadathur/IntroductionToMCMC/blob/master/lecture_slides_EuclidSchool.pdf).
