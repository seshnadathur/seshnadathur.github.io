I am an [STFC](https://stfc.ukri.org/) [Ernest Rutherford 
Fellow](https://stfc.ukri.org/funding/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowship/) at [University College 
London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/). I study the properties of dark energy, dark matter and gravity using data on the large-scale structure of the Universe 
gathered by galaxy surveys on the world's leading telescopes.

My background
======
I grew up in Delhi, India, where I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Delhi. I won a [Rhodes 
Scholarship](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/) to the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) in 2005, where I 
took an MPhys degree at Trinity College. I then held a Clarendon Domus scholarship during my DPhil (PhD), which I 
completed in 2011. I held short postdoctoral positions at the University of Bielefeld and the University of Helsinki 
before taking up a [Marie Sk&#0322;odowska-Curie Individual 
Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) and the Dennis Sciama 
Fellowship at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth in 2015.

My research
======
My research covers theory, simulation and observational cosmology, with a focus on methods of analysing galaxy survey 
data to understand the effects of dark energy and dark matter in the Universe. I use a combination of many techniques 
to achieve this, including redshift-space distortions, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing and 
secondary CMB anisotropies. I am particularly interested in the use of cosmic voids – low-density regions identified in 
3D maps of the galaxy distribution – as exciting tools to enhance the effectiveness of all these analyses. I also work 
on models of decaying dark matter and inflation in the early Universe.

I am a member of several international survey collaborations:
- ESA [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org)
- the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov)) survey
- the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ([eBOSS](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss)), part of the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey ([SDSS-IV](https://www.sdss.org/))
- the Dark Energy Survey ([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org))

Other interests 
====
I am a keen hiker, mountaineer and climber. While at Oxford I served as both Secretary and Treasurer of the 
[OUMC](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~climbing/), and I have climbed, organised expeditions and recorded occasional first 
ascents in the Indian Himalaya, the Alps, the Dolomites, the Moroccan Anti-Atlas, and the Pyrenees. I am a keen squash 
player, and have played club cricket in 3 different countries (can you guess which three?).
