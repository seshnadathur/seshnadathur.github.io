Welcome to my website! My name is Seshadri Nadathur, and I am a Research Fellow at the [Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation](http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/) (until Dec 2020), and [STFC](https://stfc.ukri.org/) [Ernest Rutherford Fellow](https://stfc.ukri.org/funding/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowship/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/) (from Jan 2021).

I study the properties of dark energy, dark matter and gravity using data on large-scale structure of the Universe gathered by galaxy surveys on the world's leading telescopes.

My background
======
I grew up in Delhi, India, where I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Delhi. I was a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/) (India & Trinity) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) from 2005 to 2007. I completed my DPhil (PhD) in Theoretical Physics at Oxford in 2011, where I held a Clarendon Domus scholarship and Overseas Research Award. I then held short postdoctoral positions at the University of Bielefeld and the University of Helsinki before taking up a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) and the Dennis Sciama Postdoctoral Fellowship at the ICG in Portsmouth.

My research
======
My research covers theory, simulation and observational cosmology, with a focus on methods of analysing galaxy survey data to understand the effects of dark energy and dark matter in the Universe. I use a combination of many techniques to achieve this, including redshift-space distortions, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing and secondary CMB anisotropies. I am particularly interested in the use of cosmic voids – low-density regions identified in 3D maps of the galaxy distribution – as exciting tools to enhance the effectiveness of all these analyses. I also work on models of decaying dark matter and inflation in the early Universe.

I am a member of several international survey collaborations:
- ESA [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/?_ga=2.46415655.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477)
- the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/?_ga=2.83984153.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477)) survey
- the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ([eBOSS](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/?_ga=2.37810211.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477)), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ([SDSS-IV](https://www.sdss.org/))
- the Dark Energy Survey ([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/?_ga=2.1317809.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477))
