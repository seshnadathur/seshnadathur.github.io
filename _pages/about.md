Welcome to my website! My name is Seshadri Nadathur, and I am a Research Fellow at the [Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation](http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/) (until Dec 2020), and [STFC](https://stfc.ukri.org/) [Ernest Rutherford Fellow](https://stfc.ukri.org/funding/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowship/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/) (from Jan 2021). I study the properties of dark energy, dark matter and gravity using data on large-scale structure of the Universe gathered by galaxy surveys on the world's leading telescopes. I am particularly interested in novel probes based on the use of cosmic voids.

My background
======
I grew up in Delhi, India, where I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Delhi. I was a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/) (India & Trinity) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) from 2005 to 2007. I completed my DPhil (PhD) in Theoretical Physics at Oxford in 2011, where I held a Clarendon Domus scholarship and Overseas Research Award. I then held short postdoctoral positions at the University of Bielefeld and the University of Helsinki before taking up a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) and the Dennis Sciama Postdoctoral Fellowship at the ICG in Portsmouth.

My research
======
I am interested in methods of analysing galaxy survey data to understand the effects of dark energy and dark matter on the rate of expansion and the distribution of matter in the Universe. I use a combination of many techniques to achieve this, including modelling redshift-space distortions, galaxy clustering, gravitational lensing, cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background and structure formation. I am particularly interested in the use of cosmic voids – low-density regions identified in 3D maps of the galaxy distribution – as exciting tools to enhance the effectiveness of all these analyses. I also work on theoretical models of decaying dark matter and inflation in the early Universe. My work covers theory, simulation and observational cosmology.

I am a member of several international survey collaborations:
- [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/?_ga=2.46415655.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477)
- the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/?_ga=2.83984153.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477))
- the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ([eBOSS](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/?_ga=2.37810211.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477)), part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ([SDSS-IV](https://www.sdss.org/))
- the Dark Energy Survey ([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/?_ga=2.1317809.1079985913.1604922658-1106304154.1581260477))
