My name is Seshadri Nadathur, and I am a Research Fellow at the [Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation](http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/) (until Dec 2020), and [STFC](https://stfc.ukri.org/) [Ernest Rutherford Fellow](https://stfc.ukri.org/funding/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowship/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/) (from Jan 2021). I study the properties of dark energy, dark matter and gravity using data on large-scale structure of the Universe gathered by galaxy surveys on the world's leading telescopes. I am particularly interested in novel probes based on the use of cosmic voids.

My background
======
I grew up in Delhi, India, where I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Delhi. I was a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/) (India & Trinity) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) from 2005 to 2007. I completed my DPhil (PhD) in Theoretical Physics at Oxford in 2011, where I held a Clarendon Domus scholarship and Overseas Research Award. I then held short postdoctoral positions at the University of Bielefeld and the University of Helsinki before taking up a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) and the Dennis Sciama Postdoctoral Fellowship at the ICG in Portsmouth.
