My research uses measurements of the large-scale distribution of matter and galaxies in the Universe to learn about dark energy and cosmology.
This work covers theory, simulation and observations of redshift-space distortions, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing and secondary CMB anisotropies.
I am best known for my work developing the use of *cosmic voids* as a precision tool for such studies.  

I am a member of the Euclid, DESI, DES and eBOSS galaxy survey collaborations. In Euclid, I am co-lead of the Voids Work Package (WP:V) and validation lead for the galaxy sample selection (SEL-ID) and spectroscopic visibility mask (VMSP-ID) processing functions in the Science Ground Segment.
