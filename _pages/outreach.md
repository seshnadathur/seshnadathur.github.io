TV

I appeared on [*Magic Numbers: Hannah Fry's Mysterious World of 
Maths*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bn9dth) which played on BBC4, and was also a science consultant for some of 
the content. (You can watch the full episode on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKKUZoqSTxw&ab_channel=oscarmanrique).)

Public speaking

I enjoy giving accessible public talks and lectures about astronomy, usually aimed at ages 14+. Some examples of talks 
I have given are:
- at Stargazing Live Portsmouth, a large annual astronomy event held at the [Historic 
Dockyard](https://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/index.php) (2016 and 2017)
- at the Winchester Science Festival
- and to the [Hampshire Astronomical Group](https://hantsastro.org.uk/)
