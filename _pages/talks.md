A few months ago, I spoke about my research on Shaun Hotchkiss's [Cosmology
Talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCstdttIo3HM6h3hDk_v2hug) seminar/podcast series; you can view the video of that
[on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UivvhqEuVuo&ab_channel=CosmologyTalks). (The entire series is well worth
viewing!)

I also gave a short talk about some of the eBOSS DR16 results at the [*Cosmology from
Home*](https://www.cosmologyfromhome.com/) conference; you can view the video of that talk
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHOS5Cba_No&ab_channel=CosmologyfromHome).

Slides for a recent talk I gave at the Heidelberg ITP in November 2020 – covering similar ground to the above two, but
in a much longer colloquium format – are available to view
[here](http://seshnadathur.github.io/files/Nadathur_void-galaxy_colloquium.pdf).
